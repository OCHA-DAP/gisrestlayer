README - HDX JOB PROCESSOR
==========================

Name
----
HDX JOB PROCESSOR, formerly known as "GISRestLayer" or "Gislayer"

Short description
-----------------

This tool is evolving from just providing a way to asynchronously run the Geopreview process to a more general tool for 
asynchronously executing tasks for HDX (CKAN). 
For now it just deals with 2 tasks:

   #. `Geopreview Processing`_
   #. `Sending Analytics Events`_ 


The tools is based on `Redis Queue <http://python-rq.org/>`_

Geopreview Processing
---------------------

This manages the transformation process of GIS data files ( geojson, kml, kmz, zipped shapefiles ) into a Postgres / PostGIS database. 
From there, the GIS data can be served by using the `PGRestAPI server ( aka Spatial Server ) <https://github.com/spatialdev/PGRestAPI>`_.
The gained advantages is that the PGRestAPI can serve:

* `Mapbox Vector Tiles <https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec>`_   
* simplfied geometries depending on zoom level

How geopreview works
++++++++++++++++++++

#. User uploads GIS data file on CKAN
#. HDX JOB PROCESSOR is notified about the new file
#. | GISRestLayer then delegates all the import process tasks to Redis Queue ( and itâ€™s workers ). The name of the queue **geo_q** .
     The worker code is part of this repository in: :code:`importapi.tasks.create_preview`
#. The worker downloads the data
#. Uses [ogr2ogr](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html) to import it in PostGIS
   * after this is finished PGRestAPI can already start serving tiles
#. Notifies CKAN that the task is complete. If successful, CKAN can show the user a preview of the data
  
  
Notes
+++++

* We're using a slightly modified fork of PGRestAPI `<https://bitbucket.org/agartner/hdx-pgrestapi>`_ 
  It allows serving new layers without restarting the server
  
  
Sending Analytics Events
------------------------

This manages the sending of data to analytics servers like Mixpanel or Google Analytics.

How analytics work
++++++++++++++++++

#. CKAN sends all the event metadata to HDX JOB PROCESSOR
#. HDX JOB PROCESSOR then creates tasks in Redis Queue in a queue called **analytics_q** .
#. Workers then send the information to analytics servers. 
   The worker code is part of this repository in: :code:`analyticsapi.tasks.send_event`
